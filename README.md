FFVC
====

Frontflow/violet Cartesian is a three-dimensional unsteady incompressible thermal flow simulator 
on a Cartesian grid system. This solver is designed so as to assist practical design in industry 
fields by powerful voxel based approach and to achieve higher parallel performance on massively
parallel computers.
